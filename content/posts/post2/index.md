## Introduction

**What are microplastics?**

Microplastics are particles between 5mm and 1um made from syththetic polymers (plastics) [1]. They occur in several different morphologies,  including fragments, fibers, films, foams, and pellets/beads [2].

**Why do we care about microplastics in freshwater?**

Microplastics are ubiquitous in our food, water, and air [3]. Scientists have also observed them in virtually every human tissue [4]. There are growing concerns microplastic exposure may represent a threat to public health [5]. Since many routes of exposure ultimately depend on microplastic transport by freshwater systems, elucidating microplastic behavior in freshwater systems is critical to managing and mitigating human microplastic exposure.

**Why develop new techniques and equipment?**

1) Neuston net tow methods produce significant underestimates and high degrees of uncertainty [6]
2) Many sample processing techniques are time consuming [7] and constrain the total numer of samples processed, limiting spatiotemporal resolution

## Hypotheses

**Microplastics in Surface Waters:**

Short-term variability (days to weeks) in microplastic concentrations in the surface waters of  rivers,  lakes, and reservoirs are principally controlled by:

1) upstream riverine bed sediment resuspension and erosion (positively correlated)
2) biofouling/aggregation (negatively correlated)
3) discharge/flow velocity (riverine settings-positively correlated)

These factors can be measured via total suspended sediment (TSS), chlorophyll  fluorescence/particulate organic matter (POM), and USGS river gauges, respectively. 

**Microplastics in Bed Sediments:**

Microplastics in bed sediments are a proxy for past microplastic fluxes and track long-term variability (years to decades). They are principally controlled by the areal extent of plastic-intensive land use categories:

4) Developed Land (positively correlated)
5) Cropland (positively correlated)
